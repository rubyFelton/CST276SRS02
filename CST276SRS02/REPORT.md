# CST276SRS02  

Date Validation Strategy/Template Method  

Name: Ruby Felton 

---
Issues: was not very thoroughly tested, could not get asserts to work, abort was called
ran out of time to impliment


Notes:  
to extend the none pattern implimentation to accept another formate I added it to the enum of formatts and made a new case in the switch statement.
to extend the patterned implimentation I created a new class whos validate function was constructed to handle that formatt
ran out of time to implement templet pattern but described in my DateI18N.h file how I intended to do it
